    <h1>Introducing Roblox The Forge Calculator: Your Ultimate Crafting Companion</h1>
    <div class="meta">Published: December 4, 2025 • 8 min read</div>

    <h2>What is The Forge Calculator?</h2>
    <p>If you've ever played <strong>The Forge</strong> on Roblox, you know how challenging it can be to figure out the perfect ore combinations for crafting legendary weapons and armor. That's exactly why we created <strong>The Forge Calculator</strong> - a free, web-based tool designed to take the guesswork out of forging.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
    <p>The Forge is an incredible game with deep crafting mechanics, but let's be honest - manually calculating which ore combinations will give you the best modifiers, or figuring out how many ores you need for optimal trait percentages, can be frustrating and time-consuming.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wasting resources</strong> on suboptimal crafts</li>
        <li><strong>Complex calculations</strong> for modifier multipliers</li>
        <li><strong>Uncertainty</strong> about trait activation</li>
        <li><strong>Time spent</strong> doing mental math instead of playing</li>
